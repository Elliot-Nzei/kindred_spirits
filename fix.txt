Accessibility
Buttons must have discernible text: Element has no title attribute
Compatibility
'-webkit-mask-image' is not supported by Firefox. Add 'mask-image' to support Firefox 53+.
'user-select' is not supported by Safari. Add '-webkit-user-select' to support Safari 3+.
'content-type' header charset value should be 'utf-8'.
'min-height: auto' is not supported by Firefox 22+.
'text-size-adjust' is not supported by Firefox, Safari.
Performance
A 'cache-control' header is missing or empty.
Resource should use cache busting but URL does not match configured patterns.
Response should not include unneeded headers: content-security-policy
Response should not include unneeded headers: x-xss-protection
Security
Response should include 'x-content-type-options' header.
The 'Expires' header should not be used, 'Cache-Control' should be preferred.
The 'X-Frame-Options' header should not be used. A similar effect, with more consistent support and stronger checks, can be achieved with the 'Content-Security-Policy' header and 'frame-ancestors' directive.
Other
Incorrect use of <label for=FORM_ELEMENT>
'box-sizing' should be listed after '-webkit-box-sizing'.
'transform' should be listed after '-webkit-transform'.
'transition' should be listed after '-webkit-transition'.
A form field element should have an id or name attribute
