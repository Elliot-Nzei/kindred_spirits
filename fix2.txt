Compatibility
'text-size-adjust' is not supported by Firefox, Safari.
Performance
A 'cache-control' header is missing or empty.
Response should not include unneeded headers: content-security-policy
Security
Response should include 'x-content-type-options' header.
The 'X-Frame-Options' header should not be used. A similar effect, with more consistent support and stronger checks, can be achieved with the 'Content-Security-Policy' header and 'frame-ancestors' directive.
Other
'transform' should be listed after '-webkit-transform'.
